Note that the examples are compiled as part of the normal build,
and have simple sanity tests found under tests/
All newly added examples must contain such a test.
This is done to prevent bitrot.

To make the examples buildable both as a part of the normal
framework build, and as a stand-alone examples package, the BUILD_TYPE
is used.
The value "unittest" means normal framework build, and "skeleton" means
stand-alone. The value "skeleton-legacy" should be used for examples
that need to build differently as examples for framework in legacy mode.
When not in unittest mode, the build cannot refer to directories below examples/
