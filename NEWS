CHANGES SINCE 0.80.4
* PySide bindings for Maliit Plugin API
  - Python plugins can now make use of the generic plugin loader found at
    https://github.com/renatofilho/maliit-python - together with the new plugin
    factory MImAbstractPluginFactory, the requirement for a Qt/C++ wrapper in
    the case of Python plugins has been eliminated.
* New plugin switch handling
  - SwitchPreparationBackward, SwitchPreparationForward and SwitchCanceled,
    required for new panning gesture to change between plugins/subviews.
* New MAbstractInputMethodHost::preeditClickPos() API:
  - Forwards the preedit-local coordinate to input method plugins.
* New MAbstractInputMethodHost::setLanguage(QString) API
  - New method setLanguage added to D-Bus interface. Through this method plugins
    can give applications a hint of the language user is going to write.

BUG FIXES
* Fixes: NB#277834 - libmaliit seg. fault in libmeegotouch unit tests:
  ut_mtextedit and ut_minputmethodstate
* Fixes: BMC#19298 - [FEA] Provide PySide bindings for Maliit Plugin API

0.80.2
======

CHANGES SINCE 0.80.1
* New libmaliit contains additional API for application developers to interact
  with input methods (besides Qt's input context API):
  - Maliit::InputMethod: Query input method area and control input method
    orientation,
  - Maliit::AttributeExtension: Allows to control input method toolbar and
    customization of certain virtual keyboard keys,
  - Maliit::PreeditInjectionEvent: Used by text entries to inject a new preedit
    into the input context,
  - Maliit namespace for all input method related enums, superseds MInputMethod
    namespace.
* New input context name:
  - Use QT_IM_MODULE=Maliit for regular builds and QT_IM_MODULE=MInputContext
    for legacy builds.
* Script for making Maliit Plugin SDK tarball.
* Enabled all unit tests again.

======

CHANGES SINCE 0.20.20
* Maliit rebranding:
  - Libraries:
    - libmeegoimframework => libmaliit-plugins
    - libmeegoimquick => libmaliit-plugins-quick
  - Binaries:
    - meego-im-uiserver => maliit-server
  - Plugins install paths:
    - /usr/lib/meego-im-plugins => /usr/lib/maliit/plugins-x.y
* Added library versioning
  - Allows for parallel installation of different versions
* Removed internal libmeegotouch dependency
  - MPreeditInjectionEvent, MInputMethodState added to new experimental
    libmaliit
* Improved build infrastructure:
  - Common defines for install paths, names, etc.
  - Better pkg-config support (whilst deprecating prf files)
  - Better install prefix handling through M_IM_PREFIX

BUG FIXES
* Fixes: BMC#18772 - meego-im-uiserver is changing the window type after it's
  window is mapped

0.20.11
=======
* Added support for enabling/disabling plguins and subviews.
  - MAbstractInputMethod::subViews() should return all subviews instead of
    just the enabled ones now
  - The new GConf keys :
    - /meegotouch/inputmethods/onscreen/enabled
    - /meegotouch/inputmethods/onscreen/active
    replace the old ones:
    - /meegotouch/inputmethods/plugins/onscreen
    - /meegotouch/inputmethods/virtualkeyboard/layouts
    - /meegotouch/inputmethods/virtualkeyboard/lastactivesubview

0.20.10
=======
* Added basic framework support for QML-based plugins:
  - MInputMethodQuick: A MInputMethod implementation that sets up a QML
    environment and exposes a MInputMethodQuick context to the QML side.
  - MInputMethodQuickPlugin: A ready-made plugin wrapper, to use it reimplement
    MInputMethodQuickPlugin::qmlFileName and MInputMethodPlugin::name.

0.20.0
=======
* Removed MeeGo Touch from public API.
* Allow to build framework without MeeGo Touch (optional)
  - Use "$ qmake CONFIG=+nomeegotouch -r ." or
    "DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nomeegotouch".
* New helper classes:
  - MImGraphicsView: Use this widget if your input method plugin uses
    QGraphicsView (or QDeclarative*).
  - MImWidget: Use this widget if your input method offers a tradtional
    QWidget-based UI.
  - Both widgets boost render performance of input method plugins by using the
    framework's latest self-compositing feature. Check their documentation for
    subclassing advice. Also, in case you cannot reuse these classes, you need
    to use MAbstractInputMethodHost::background - if null, it can be ignored.
    Otherwise, it needs to be drawn into the background of your central widget
    (assuming full-screen widgets). For QWidgets, this can be done in
    QWidget::paintEvent. For QGraphicsView, it is required to override
    QGraphicsView::drawBackground instead.
  - MImHwKeyboardTracker: Tracks state (open/closed) of HW keyboard (does not
    provide any functionality yet when framework is build without MeeGo Touch
    support).
  - MImSettings: Currently a wrapper for GConf, but supposed to be extended for
    GConf-less platforms.
* API changes:
  - Removed MIMSettingsDialog (use settings applet instead).
    - Removed MAbstractInputMethodHost::showSettings, too. This means that IM
      plugins can no longer request the settings dialog.
  - Removed MPlainWindow.
  - MAbstractInputMethod:
    - c'tor now takes an additional QWidget parameter, the
      main window (top level widget) supplied by the framework. This frees
      plugins from using MPlainWindow. Plugins can now choose between
      traditonal QWidget UI's or QGraphicsView UI's (including MeeGo Touch and
      QML). Make sure to reparent your central widget to the main window.
    - centralWidget: Returns central widget of your plugin.
    - setCentralWidget: Sets central widget of your plugin. Important if you
      want to take advantage of self-composting by using MImGraphicsView or
      MImWidget.
  - MInputMethodPlugin:
    - createInputMethod: Takes an additional QWidget parameter, the main
      window. Parameter is supplied by framework.
  - MInputMethod namespace:
    - added OrientationAngle, Orientation, TextContentType (copied from MeeGo Touch)
